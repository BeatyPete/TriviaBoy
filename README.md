##Mockup:

Replaced correct/wrong labels with triviaboy. End score can show up as -1 if timer gets to 0 but it is always saved to scoreboard as 0. Theres no conditions on the initials input for submitting score, so theres no limit on what the user can put in even if they put in nothing. Could probably fix with window prompt and ifs but I dont feel like it.
